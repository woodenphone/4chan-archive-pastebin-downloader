Notes for pastebin downloader and foolfuuka archive link finder

Important not to users:
This stuff isn't supported for any use without a lifetime pro account correctly set up for your IP.
I'm not going to bother even trying to bypass any anti-scraping measures the account can fix.



-Known bad paste contents-
These are error messages.
    'Error, we cannot find this paste.'
    Signifies that a paste was either deleted or never existed
    
    'Error, this is not a public paste.'
    Signifies that this paste is not set to public - may be either unlisted or private
    Should recheck these ones with different method such as webpage or non-api /raw/

    'Error, this is a private paste. If this is your private paste, please login to Pastebin first.':# Private paste /raw/
    When trying to use the public/basic /raw/ link for a private paste

Regex for finding paste title from the paste page HTML
# Allowed characters for a title:
Seems to include too many for simpler regex
# From my testing, this is possible:
    <div class="paste_box_line1" title="&quot;><h1>Fake Title</h1></div>"><h1>"&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Fake Title&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</h1></div>
# Known valid title:
    <div class="paste_box_line1" title="Mirrors Edge Ch1 (derpy)"><h1>Mirrors Edge Ch1 (derpy)</h1></div>   
# Convert spaces to \s
<div\sclass="paste_box_line1"\stitle="Mirrors Edge Ch1 (derpy)"><h1>Mirrors Edge Ch1 (derpy)</h1></div>
# Crop down to a single instance of the title and capture the title
<div\sclass="paste_box_line1"\stitle="([0-9a-zA-Z]{})">
